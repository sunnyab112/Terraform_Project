# Deploying a Highly Available and Scalable WordPress Web Server on AWS Using EC2, RDS, and Autoscaling. 
# Setting Up the Environment: Creating Necessary AWS Resources Provisioning a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with all essential components, including Subnets, Security Groups (SG), Internet Gateway (IGW), Route Tables. Configuration of two Availability Zones (AZ) with a Public Subnet and a Private Subnet in each. 
# Initial Deployment: EC2 Instance as a WordPress Web Server Deployment and configuration of EC2 instance as a WordPress web server using a startup script in the User Data section. 
# Setting up a local MySQL database on the EC2 instance. Adding an Amazon RDS instance for the WordPress database, using a Multi-AZ deployment in the private subnet. 
# Adjusting the startup script to connect the WordPress application to the RDS database. 
# Security Enhancement: Implementing a Bastion Host. Deploying a Bastion Host in the public subnet to securely manage access to instances within the private subnet. 
# Architecture Refinement: Moving WordPress Servers to Private Subnet. 
# Shift the WordPress EC2 servers from the public subnet to the private subnet for enhanced security. Set up a NAT Gateway to enable outbound internet access for instances in the private subnet. 
# Scalability: Implementing Autoscaling and Load Balancing. 
# Configuring an Autoscaling Group for the WordPress instances to ensure high availability and scalability. 
# Add an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in front of the EC2 instances for efficient traffic distribution and improved performance.
